# SportsTriviaGame
For my game I decided to go with a football trivia game. I initially was going to make a platformer type game, but I wasn't creative enough to come up with any cool ideas that I liked. Playing the game is pretty intuitive. At the start there is a play button which then takes you to the main game.html file where the majority of the logic/content is. As far as I know there shouldn't be any game-play bugs, however there were some styling issues I came across which I am still working on. The main one being that the div where the buttons you press to select your answer don't stay the same size, which isn't a huge deal as they don't move much, however I am working on getting that fixed. Another thing I can still work on would be to add more questions to my question array as coming across the same 10 questions gets pretty repetitive. Other than that though I really enjoyed this project. I learned so much especially about DOM manipulation and extracting data from an array, as well as I thought this was fantastic review on HTML and CSS.
